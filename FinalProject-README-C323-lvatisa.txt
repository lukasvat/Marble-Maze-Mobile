Final Project
Lukas Vatistas (lvatista@iu.edu)

Individual README

the parts of the Final Project you have personally completed
	I completed all views for the app (settings, stats, all 3 mazes), along with
	SettingsViewController.swift, StatsViewController.swift. I worked heavily with
	Sprite Kit to make all 3 of the mazes. I coded most of the model, created all the
	files at the start of the project, and worked on GameScene.swift some as well. There
	were other small contributions I made, but these are the main.

any interesting parts you may have added
	The most interesting parts I added were the 3 different maps. Each have a different
	difficulty (easy, medium, and hard) and it was difficult at first to make each map
	a certain difficulty. But I am proud of the outcome.

	Nope, everyone contributed to the assignment a good amount.
	
Are there any problems with your Team?
	There were no problems with my team at all, I think we worked really well together
	and were able to communicate very effectively.
